 * Repository used to retrieve users from the database. Note that this repository was created in conjunction with

 * instead of having to switch between user type until we find the correct one. This works by making {@link UserEntity}
 * and its subclass effectively a single table in the database. Hence any operations from this repository can be used
 * against all user types at once, which is not possible for {@link helloapp.repositories.UserRepository}.
